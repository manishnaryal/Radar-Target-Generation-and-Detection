% % Select the grid that includes the training, guard and test cells. Grid Size = (2Tr+2Gr+1)(2Td+2Gd+1).
% % The total number of cells in the guard region and cell under test. (2Gr+1)(2Gd+1).
% % This gives the Training Cells : (2Tr+2Gr+1)(2Td+2Gd+1) - (2Gr+1)(2Gd+1)
% % Measure and average the noise across all the training cells. This gives the threshold
% % Add the offset (if in signal strength in dB) to the threshold to keep the false alarm to the minimum.
% % Determine the signal level at the Cell Under Test.
% % If the CUT signal level is greater than the Threshold, assign a value of 1, else equate it to zero.

%For every iteration sum the signal level within all the training
%cells. To sum convert the value from logarithmic to linear using db2pow
%function. Average the summed values for all of the training
%cells used. After averaging convert it back to logarithimic using pow2db.
%Further add the offset to it to determine the threshold. Next, compare the
%signal under CUT with this threshold. If the CUT level > threshold assign
